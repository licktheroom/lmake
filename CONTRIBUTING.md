## Issues
 * Check if this issue has already been reported or if this feature was already requested. If it has, just comment on that.
 * Be concise, it's hard to fix a bug if all you say is "It didn't work."
 * Be sure to provide the command you used or the contents of your .lmake file.
 * Provide screen shots of what you got in the terminal or just copy and paste it.
## Pull requests
 * Be concise, what bug does this fix, or what does this add, and how?
 * If you're adding something, provide a sample command to show how it works.
## Coding conventions
 * Indent your functions and if statments (use tab!).
 * Space tables and declarations. It's not ```a={"a","b","c"}```, it's ```a = {"a", "b", "c"}```.
